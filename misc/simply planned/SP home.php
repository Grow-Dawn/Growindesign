    <p><br>Kamus and Sarah have been making planners for 15 years and have always been on a quest for the perfect planner.  In college they spent most of their book money on leather Franklin planners… their true obsession began when Sarah spotted a friend’s homemade planner with a simple hand written layout.  From there thousands of different layouts sprung… one had rip out weekly shopping/to-do lists... but the planner turned out to be 6 inches thick and weighed 100 pounds … not their best design.  They made many hair raising trips to Kinko’s with children in-tow, spilling pends, crying, and lying on the floor as they anxiously waited for covers to be laminated and bindings to be coiled.  Some of their favorite homemade planners were decked with collage covers of “all thing inspiring”. <br> <br>
    They are natural enthusiast organizers who like to go organize friend’s kitchens and spices for fun.  Kamus’ labeler is always going … her husband had put his foot down and won’t allow her to label the toilet!  They get “jazzed” about cleaning things out, organizing!  Sarah tends to over use her planner and Kamus tries to avoid hers, but there’s no doubt, they are planner enthusiasts to the core!<br>
