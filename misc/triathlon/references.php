   <p><br>Never having been to California myself, let alone San Francisco, I relied a lot on friends and the internet for photos and information.  The photos all came from my good friend Vickie Lundgren who was a blessing in more ways than one as she described places and where everything was.  I spent literally hours on Google following streets to see how the streets and route would appear to a spectator and the participants who would be the audience.  I almost feel like I have been there now.  
   <br><br>Since I have never been to San Francisco I had to rely on friends for advice and knowledge. 
     
   <br><br> Google “street views” became helpful when looking at the view from a runners and cyclers point of view.  Vickie Lundgren provided all the photos and first-hand knowledge of places she had been to for the loop.<br> </p>
