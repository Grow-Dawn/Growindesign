    <p class="right"><br> Sarah works part time as a nurse in a local primary care doctor’s office.  She loves to read, sew, bake bread and be at home.  She gets excited about gathering eggs, growing vegetables, canning, watching old movies, and being outside in the sun.  She is also busy with 5 children … three of which are now outstanding adults.  Her last two little boys are keeping her and her husband busy and they hope young.  They recently bought a farm they are remodeling and are enjoying the simple country life in beautiful Northern Idaho.  They can see mountains out every window of their cozy little house; the Canadian Mountains from out their front window.  She hopes to someday serve as a humanitarian nurse and have lots of grand-babies.  Her goal this year is to learn how to run the TV and DVD player and in the near future, to go on a trip to Hawaii with her Simply Planned partner!
