           This has been a bit trying.  I have had a headache to deal with along with a few customers at work and homework all in between.  My 230 class has been filled with getting my information and ideas pinned down.  The problem is meeting with the girls to know what they have in mind for their website.  I am meeting with them in a few minutes to help me get the architecture of the site and site plan drawn up.  I believe we are on the same path.  I was able to change a few things on my site to suit myself.  I added css code to change the background, font color and size, and to alter the links when hovered over.  I figured php was similar to html so tested it with css and ‘yeah, me!’  Most of my work this semester will be in the link labeled “Simply Planned” which will eventually become the girl’s website to be relocated.  It will be built here and moved later.  For now it will be here with access to the journal links required for the class.  I met with Kamus (one of the girls) and we covered everything she hopes to get out of the site while viewing another site they liked.  We went over what we did and did not like about the other site to solidify more what they were looking for.  We met for over an hour just this time, not including the many contacts back and forth over the week bringing my practice time up to 3-4 hours total.  I still expect a few changes as we go along.  I gave her some homework: picking out final paper patterns, getting me the logo they created along with the font of choice, coming up with ideas that they want to use for their video and seeing if they want testimonials on their product.  Overall I got a better handle on it.  I was also able to tweak my site more to my taste.  <br>
    A problem I am encountering is sharing NetBeans between 230 and 260.  It seems that every time I try to test/run my program for 260 it tries to upload it to my website for 230.  I am hoping to get some help soon with that issue.  I am think I may have solved the issue or found a way around it.
