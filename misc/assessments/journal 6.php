           The beginning of this week has been fairly easy too, thank heavens since I had a migraine which escalated by Wednesday.  I did go into my code and change one of the 'b' with 'strong' even though it seems like it takes up more characters.  <br>
   Hmmm, I may have figured out one of the problems with a spot on my site.  I think I either need to delete or add a list to my journals links, will have to review this further.   I am having a few problems with my site, a few things are not quite the way I want them and when I load my site to Mozilla it remembers the way it was so I have to load it into Chrome to get a more accurate viewing.  This is frustrating.  I still need to get together with the girls to get my audio and video for the site, hopefully before it is due.  I spent a lot of time this week adding other pages to Simply Planned.  I added at least 4 more pages including the teaching presentation.  Then I turned totally frustrated when I tried to add some video and audio I had to fill in since the girls didn’t get together with me.  The audio went on fine but the video is having problems and I think the instructions for this week were incomplete.  I tried multiple times to get it running, even loaded it onto YouTube and it still isn’t working.  I need to give up and work on other homework.  I cannot continue to work more than the 10+ hours I have spent on one item.  I made the video into mp4 (about 6 diff ways), webm (about 3 diff ways), flv,(never worked), 3gp  (never worked) and avi (too big).  I did finish my contact form but the instructions again were confusing but was able to get it running in the end.   I think the form should have been done last week or next week so the week wasn’t so full considering we had to also add the audio and video.
