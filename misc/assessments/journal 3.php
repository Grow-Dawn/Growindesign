           The girls still haven’t come up with the choices for paper and thus, the background for their website yet.  It is hard waiting on a client to accomplish what is needed.   We have decided to use the type that she purchased online which goes with her planners and another of my choosing that compliments it.  I think we will go with a few of the planner paper as the backdrop top for the header.  She gave me 2 different logo prints to use for the header also.  I spent a few hours tweaking my site the way I want, making small changes that bug me.  I still am trying to get the image as the background and am shooting to get it up on Simply Planned by the weekend.  A lot of the article topics this week were covered either in my art classes or in WDD100 so this is more of a review.  I was thrown for a loop though when I read that we are supposed to have all of our files for our class as html5 when the original instructions in week one suggested that the index page be set up as a php file.  I guess now this means we will have to change all of our files since I started making them all php, oh yeah!  By the way, so far I am NOT impressed with html5.  I may change them all back to php still.  I went ahead and added my journal pages for the rest of the year for practice time.<br>
           I am still being challenged with my NB connecting to GH but I persevere and digress.  It just makes things more challenging when trying to work with Patrick on the assignments.  I have to copy whatever changes I want to make or the whole code, go to GH and ‘edit’ the code I need to change and paste it in to save/commit.  If he makes changes he has to get ahold of me so I can go in to copy them and paste into my NB.  What a pain!  I don’t know where to go to get help with this.  The forums are confusing and everything I try fails on it.  I am tempted to reinstall or delete it all and start from scratch.  I finally got it fixed!  I went in and figured it out … all on my lonesome!<br>
