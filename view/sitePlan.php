      1. Know Your Audience ~ possible clients for GrowinDesign, people who need a website built or logo made for their business. They are generally woman from all walks of life seeking something beautiful to help their business.  <br>
      2. Less is More ~ they want to find links and information simple and readable.  The appearance should be beautiful, subtle and inviting.<br><br>
      

   The home page will direct the user to other pages.  Other pages will be About Me, a contact page, a gallery of artwork, and a login to LIKE the artwork shown.  This should be a clutter-free site that is easy to use.  I want links to sites I have already built. <br>
I am going with a gradient blue sky background above a dark charcoal mountain silhouette.  The font type I chose was white Adobe Garamond except for my logo which is in a dark blue Marquisette.  The links turn the same dark blue when hovered over. The site plan diagram is in all the colors.<br><br>
