        This week I decided to make my site more clean and simple.  I created a page on my main page just for my school work in this class.  I threw all of my journals, site plan, and practice plan all in this page.  It leaves it so if anyone is wanting to find something they don’t have to read everything to find what they are looking for.  I am still having problems getting my background picture to work.  I also discovered that php and html do not mix.  I still don’t know if we are supposed to be building our site in php or html since the first page we were guided to build in php and the instructions say it will all be in html5 but when I try to build a new one it looks like regular html.  I so far have not received a response from the teacher or DB, does it really matter?  I changed all my files to html and the new one I added I put into php but it wouldn’t work properly until I changed it to html.  I finally took the time to change it all back to php because that is what the original class instructions had us do the index code in and I never did get a response or verified confirmation what format.  I got my photo background to work and figured out what I was doing wrong.  I also got my floats to work.  I think I am ahead of the rest of the class but know I still have to work on Simply Planned so am not worried.  Next goal … figure out what Filezilla is for.<br>
