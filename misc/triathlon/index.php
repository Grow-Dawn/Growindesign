         San Quentin prison is a maximum security California state prison near San Rafael. Alcatraz Prison was a maximum-security federal prison, located on Alcatraz Island in San Francisco bay that closed in 1963.   
    In 1974, the first modern swim/bike/run event to be called a 'triathlon' in America  was held in San Diego, California at Mission Bay.  This site is set up for to represent a triathlon if one were ever to happen like this (it is NOT A REAL RACE).
    <br><br>This race will be near Half Ironman, consisting of: a run of roughly 16 miles, a challenging swim of 3 miles and a scenic cycling course of 25 miles. The cost to enter is $100. The race will begin near San Quentin, run to Fisherman's wharf, swim to Alcatraz Island and back and then bike around San Francisco bay, crossing the John T. Knox freeway and ending where the race began. This is a race between historic locales and unique in its scope.
    <br><br>Come join us in the best run/swim/bike half triathlon to happen in this century.  On May 31, 2014 we welcome all to participate in a prison to prison triathlon.
