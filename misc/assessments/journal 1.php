    A girl in one of my other classes summed up my experience for this week, “The biggest niche that needs filled is people experienced enough and smart enough to teach technological subjects, who can remember what it was like to not know ANY of the terminology, so they teach not only the processes but also explain the terminology as it's introduced and in plain English!”  I struggled quite a bit this week trying to get my software to communicate to each other.  I started my portfolio website and connected my NetBeans to it but because the website had 2 domains it caused problems (and still is, although they are now minor).  I did post on our BYUI online group that the hardest problem I will encounter this semester is getting the understanding the software and establishing communication.  In the end I was able to get Netbeans, the website, and Filezilla to communicate.  I learned a little from this.  During all this complication I learned how to use Google Hangouts and had fun with that helping and being helped with my problem by other classmates.  I even signed up my mom so we can communicate more often and so I can help her with her computer too. <br>
