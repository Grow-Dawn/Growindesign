       <p>This design was created using a play on the word.  After choosing numerous action words, one was chosen to refine. The A in the middle of the word "balance" was used as the center of a scale to show balance.  The colors show that the darker colors have more ‘weight’ than the lighter colors, lighter color for lighter weight.    </p>
