           We finally get to stuff I can really use, floats and photo sliders.  I am struggling still to get my floats to where I want them.  I haven’t given up yet though.  I have now added a border to the whole thing so I can see where the heck everything is placing.  I am still having problems getting my floats to go where I want them.  I wonder if there is conflicting stuff in my css that is the jamming up.  I will figure this out yet!  I am applying the multiple device information but don’t seem to be getting anywhere that I can see.  I found where it talks about adjusting pictures for multiple devices but this code doesn’t look like it will fit for my css background image, hmmmm.  It is going to take a little more time working out my bugs.
