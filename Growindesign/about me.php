    <h2>About Me</h2><br>



    <p><br><br><br><br><br>Dawn Grow is the mother of 4 children.  Her children are all adults now, 3 have gone on LDS missions to Chile, Peru and West Virginia. <br> 
    She and her husband own a local photo shop in North Idaho.  She opted to expand her horizons and knowledge by taking on an education in Web Design.  <br>
    Dawn is a proclaimed read-a-holic and doesnâ€™t go anywhere without a book or kindle.  Her husband fixes computers on the side so she has picked up quite a bit from him for computer savvy.   She also converts 8mm films to DVD, repairs photos, creates photo announcements making the Web Design course right for her.  She attended Ricks College 20+ years ago which is now BYU-Idaho.
