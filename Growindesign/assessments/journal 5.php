   This week has seemed pretty laid back and easier.  It helps that I am ahead in both of my classes.  My website is going to be a lot more fun and easier now that we have the modularization.  I knew there had to be an easier way to do this stuff.  I was always correcting every page that I had each time I changed my code for my journals and now I only have to change one thing and all of them change, Yeah!  At this point I really don’t feel I need the header and footer but will add it for the sake of the class.  it seems to work remarkably well and still maintains all the appearance that I was looking for, it doesn’t change it.  The overall time it took me to adjust this was minimal with copy/paste and I feel comfortable with modules.  I still need to learn how to adjust my site for all devices but feel that will be in a future lesson as it doesn’t look quite what I want to see on my tablet and my iphone.  I feel that will probably be covered in the css or something simple.
