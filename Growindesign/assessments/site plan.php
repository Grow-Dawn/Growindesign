      1. Know Your Audience – the customers for Simply Planned, women who want/desire to get organized with a personalized planner.  They are generally woman from all walks of life seeking something beautiful to keep them on track.  It will target all ages but generally 18-45.<br>
      2. Less is More - they want to find links and information simple and readable.  The pictures should be beautiful, subtle and inviting.<br>
      3. What is included in the planner's?  Monthly pages with tabs as well as an abundance of weekly planner pages, a clear cover that can be changed out for each season or mood.<br>
      4. How much do they cost?  I am going to have to still get the price list from the girls.<br>

   The home page will direct the user to other pages.  Other pages will be ‘About Us’ (bios), a gallery of pictures, and a learn more page which will go into more detail about the planners, how they are made and have the video.<br>
   They want an elegant clutter-free site that is easy to use.  They also want a link to their sister’s etsy page and possibly with a blog-like setting so some of their clients can add in their testimonials about the product.   They are simple girls so no twitter or anything fancy, only facebook (which I had to talk them into) and email.<br></p>

       <p>I am still awaiting the girls to come up with the basic prints they want to use for their backdrop but at this time I am going with a light teal with brown type until they make a decision. <br>
       They are going with a font they purchased, Vinnie Culture for one of the types and I will probably be using Gabriola for another alternate but will make my final decision when I see the 2 fonts together.<br>
       Generally they will have a background picture with a few other pictures going down the side.  the tabs will be at the top with links on the side on 'ribbons' for a homey, girly touch.  <br>
