           This week has been fairly simple for me since I already have had my css installed since week 2.  I did go back and clean up my school page by deleting the extra videos that were not working properly.  When I went back in to help someone else in class catch up (she had a baby) I noticed that my audio was deleted by mistake and so I had to put that back in where it was supposed to be.  I have also helped a few others clean up their validation so I am getting much better at that.  I did notice that my ‘main’ was between the ‘head’ and the ‘body’ and it didn’t work but someone else had hers inside of the ‘body’ and it didn’t raise any flags.  Hmmm, maybe that was where I was supposed to put it in the first place. <br>
           Now that I have fixed all the errors and got it to work, now my background page is smaller and tiled.  I fix one thing and something else gets messed up.   </p>
