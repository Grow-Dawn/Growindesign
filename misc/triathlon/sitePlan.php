   <p>    
   I decided to set up the site with a cool blue for my main color scheme for the sky and water.  <br><br>   
   I chose to put the title on top with a navigation bar running under that.  I am going to use the San Francisco Bridge as the main photo since it is one of the most popular sites. When Vickie mentioned places like Fisherman’s Wharf and Pier 39 I gave her a dumb look but I knew about the bridge.   I wanted the main wording to run straight down the middle of the page with pictures off to the right.  To balance, I want the logo with more navigation off to the left.  This will create almost a three columns effect.  I wanted the registration form to be a pdf.  Josh mentioned how to do one a few weeks ago and I think it is great.  Of course, most of the navigation will change for other media devices.<br><br>
   I have chosen for my logo a pair of shackles with the three athletic forms being ‘linked’ together from ‘prison to prison’.  I liked how the swimming took place in the middle and it made it perfect for the swimmer to be swimming through the links.  I have to say I was really excited about this and showed my logo to anyone who came into my store.  I did Google triathlon logos ahead of time to get some ideas.  <br><br>
   The slider on the home page was always in my plans.  I like the fact that pictures are very important and desire a lot to give a better visual effect.  <br><br>
