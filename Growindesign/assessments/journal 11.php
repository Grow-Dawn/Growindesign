          It is so frustrating when you take forever to fix something that is super simple.  I moved my footer to the top which made more sense.  When I did that it caused problems moving itself all over the place, anywhere but where I wanted it.  Josh finally got online with me and was able to help me figure it out.  While he was at it he helped me find a few more glitches in my css.  One of those glitches corrected the error with my slider.  I am so needing to catch up on my sleep after all the late nights this week staying up trying to fix things.  It is almost the way I want it, just need to fix the media query now and I think I have it!
