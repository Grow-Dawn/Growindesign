                Due to time restraints on my behalf, I have to practice when the time comes available.  As I own my own brick and mortar business, I need to fit in practice when it becomes available.  I am more lucky than some others who cannot focus on school while at work.  I am also taking advantage of the slow season at work to use the down time for my practice.  This is my slow season and I can switch gears fairly easily.  We open from 9am to 5:30 pm and I can work on my classes during the time I have no one in my store, yesterday I had about 5-8 people total all day.<br>
    When I get home I have a special area set up for my school work.  I spend approximately 2-3 hours each day cumulative on my 2 classes and another hour or 2 when I get home.  (I am slightly OCD and want it to look fairly perfect).  This time allocated would be divided equally between practice and preparation.  Since I only have 2 classes this semester it is do-able, this time last year I was tackling 4 classes with the same circumstances.<br>
    So to answer the questions in order:<br>
    Where?  Work and home workplace. <br>
    When?  Between customers and in my downtime at home. <br>
    How?  I usually follow the dashboard and go down the list until I have accomplished all the assignments ahead of time.  I also check the course list on the upper right of the dashboard to see if anyone has posted on the boards.  Finally, I check the course list and go down the list making sure I have the all done since some things, unfortunately, donâ€™t make it onto the dashboard.  (This assignment was not originally on the dashboard)<br>
    Who?  I go to my husband for verification and validation of my work and even use my customers for feedback.  It helps that I live in a small town thus know most of the people who come in.<br>
