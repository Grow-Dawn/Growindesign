           I continued to spend more time on my floats and positioning this week since I had a headache all week last week.  I was able to get my journal links all to float right but now need to decide what to do with my footer at the bottom.  I think I may end up moving the whole thing to the top.  I still cannot get my slideshow to slide but I will keep working on that.  Right now it shows them all on the page and that will be fine until I can get it to work.  I only spent a few hours this week on my website due to many other distractions (customers, callings, ward activities, etc).  My main question now is if we have to do a table in this project.  If so I will need to add that in, not that I want or need one.
