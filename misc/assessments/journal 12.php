            Ok, complaint time.  This final assignment must be an April Foolâ€™s joke, at least for people who have never been to California.  How the heck do they expect us to get pictures and describe the route for a fake race if we have never been there?  Let me just tell you, Google is my new best friend.  I have a friend who actually went to San Francisco recently and took pictures of what would be the route.  Thank Heavens for wonderful friends.  And her son who is currently a marine was in cross-country with my son and swam a race recently so I have some shots of that also.  Google street view is amazing.  I was able to follow the roads and find some idea or feel for the route.  
            <br><br>I think the reason I spent so much time on this project this week was because once I got started on it it was exciting and I wanted to get it all done to see the final product.  I even disregarded my other class to work on this.  The media queries was a bundle of frustration but I got it done with a few days to spare and I like it.
